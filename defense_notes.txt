Defense Cheat-Sheet (short)
1) Problem: connect all districts with min total cost â†’ MST.
2) Data: JSON (nodes, edges, weights). I validate sizes (V, E) before run.
3) Algorithms: Prim (PQ on adjacency), Kruskal (sort edges + DSU).
4) Complexity: Prim ~ O(E log V), Kruskal ~ O(E log E).
5) Why both give same total cost? MST is unique in weight sum (not necessarily in structure) for a connected graph.
6) When to choose: Prim (dense/adj list, repeated runs), Kruskal (edge list, forests, easy DSU).
7) Results: equal costs across graphs; minor differences in ops/time due to data shape.
